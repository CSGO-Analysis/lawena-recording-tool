=====================

Simple Team Fortress 2 (TF2) movie recording tool

Original project at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/lawenarecordingtool/) by Montz

To use this, clone/download this repo and execute 'buildrun.bat' to compile and package a jar that you can later execute.

####About this
- Requires Java 7.
- Currently testing if it handles the SteamPipe folder structure correctly.
- Backup your **cfg** and **custom** folders before launching TF2 from this tool while I verify that it runs well.
