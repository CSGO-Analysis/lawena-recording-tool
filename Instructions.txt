== LAWENA RECORDING TOOL v3 by Montz ==

To run the tool, double click lawena.jar (requires Java 1.7).
The first time you run it, it will ask you to locate your tf2 directory.
It's the one located in "\Steam\steamapps\common\team fortress 2\tf". Choose it and click on the "Open" button.
After that, it will ask you to select a directory to store your movie files (everything you record).
You can manually edit 'settings.lwf' with the notepad, though I don't recommend it.
To use a custom HUD for recording, copy said HUD's resource and scripts folders into "\hud\custom" and then choose Custom HUD in the HUD settings.
To use a custom Skybox for recording, simply copy said Skybox's .vtf files (not the .vmt files) into "\Skybox". The tool will automatically generate an option in the settings and a preview screenshot of the skybox.

The tool provides the following bindings:

N - Locks viewmodels so that if they were enabled when you press the key, they stay on and can't be disabled, and viceversa. This setting is overridden by restarting TF2
M - Locks default crosshair so that it cannot be changed. This setting is overridden by restarting TF2
R - Enables/disables ragdolls.
UP ARROW - Increases the recording frame rate
DOWN ARROW - Decreases the recording frame rate
P - Starts recording a series of .tga files and their respective .wav file. Each series is named XY_ where X is a letter and Y is a number between 1 and 15 

Special Thanks to Chris for his awesome config and Broesel, m0re, povohat and Barrakketh for their HUDs. Also thanks to Komaokc for his beautiful skyboxes.
